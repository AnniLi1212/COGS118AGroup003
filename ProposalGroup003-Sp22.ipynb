    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This dataset has 36 variables and 119613 observations. The actual shape of this dataset is 119,614 rows × 37 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### What an observation consists of: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each observation contains the location (where the star is located and how far it is) and some critical characteristics of each star, including its brightness, energy, color, etc. There are a total of 36 variables in each observation (some of the variables might not be available) We will use some of the critical variables below to classify star types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some critical variable in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spect: The star's spectral type. There are seven main types of stars: OBAFGKM, where O corresponds to the hottest, most powerful stars (and usually the largest) and M corresponds to the coolest, least powerful stars (and usually the smallest). The spectral type of the star will be the labels in our supervised machine learning model.\n",
    "- Distance: The star's distance in parsecs. Distance is one of the traits that we need to consider in our model because the farther away the star is from, the dimmer the star will be. We will need to use distance to more accurately measure the luminosity and the brightness of the stars.\n",
    "- Mag: The star's apparent visual magnitude. We will use the star’s apparent magnitude to determine how bright the star actually is if we observe it from the earth.\n",
    "- AbsMag: The star's absolute visual magnitude, which will be the start’s visual magnitude if we observe 10 parsecs away from the star.  This identity is crucial because it tells us how bright the star “actually” is. If a star’s absolute visual magnitude is high, it is very likely that the star has a large size and high energy.\n",
    "- Ci: The start’s B-V color index. This index will indicate the star’s color, which will be an efficient way to indicate the star’s temperature and energy. It is defined as the difference between the blue magnitude and the star’s visual magnitude. The larger the B-V color index, the higher temperature the star will be at (and also, the star will appear bluer)\n",
    "- Lum: The star's luminosity. This variable is defined by the total electromagnetic power emitted by the star in a given time, and it is shown as a multiple of the solar luminosity (where the sun’s luminosity will be defined as 1). The higher the luminosity the star is, the more energy it will release in a given time period. In other words, the higher the luminosity, the more powerful the star is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Any special handling, transformations, cleaning, etc will be needed: \n",
    "\n",
    "- This dataset contains some variables that we will not be used in classification so we will clean the data to make sure we only have the data we need. Also, the star’s spectral type contains a subtype for each class. For example, in class F, we might have F5 or F0V, etc. We will also clean the data so that we only use the general type to classify star type in order to reduce model complexity."
