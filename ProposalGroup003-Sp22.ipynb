    "We see thousands of stars hanging up high each night but rarely do we come to wonder their commonalities and differences. For our project, we decide to utilize this chance to train a model to classify each star Morgan-Keenan spectral class.\n",
    " \n",
    "The dataset we use contains roughly more than 110,000 observations with 30+ features. The row of the dataset represents a single star's information. The features of our dataset are a mixture of categorical and continuous variables, where some are relatively uninsightful, such as constellation abbreviation, proper name, etc. But others like brightness, color, and magnitude, should be contributing factors to our task. Hence, it is important for us to include decisive features.\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Since astronomy is a brand new field of wonder to every one of our team, we did a great deal of crash course and factual research in order to better position ourselves to answer the question we came up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, what is the Morgan-Keenan spectral classification system? In short, it is a systematic way introduced by William Wilson Morgan and Philip C. Keenan in 1943 that assigns spectral classification to stars based on their effective temperature. The scale, in descending order, is as follows:\n",
    "- O, >= 30,000 Kelvin,\n",
    "- B, between 10,000 and 30,000 Kelvin\n",
    "- A, between 7,500 and 10,000 Kelvin\n",
    "- F, between 6,000 and 7,500 Kelvin\n",
    "- G, between 5,200 and 6,000 Kelvin\n",
    "- K, between 3,700 and 5,200 Kevlin\n",
    "- M, between 2,400 and 3,700 Kelvin\n",
    "\n",
    "We even found an interesting trick to recite this hierarchy, that is \"**O**h **B**e **A** **F**ine **G**irl (**G**uy), **K**iss **M**e\". More factual information about spectral types and the MK system can be found here<a name=\"MK\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#MK)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, some may wonder that since it seems there is a rather obvious connection between stellar temperature and its MK spectral class, why not just scrape the temperature data and match them up? The one apparent objection we've found in regard to this is that the \"temperature\" measurement isn't something that can just be taken for granted (notice that our dataset doesn't have the temperature feature either)--it requires tremendous amount of pre-assumptions, observations, and calculations, and in the end the result one astrophysicist would arrive at may not even be accurate<a name=\"stellartemp\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#stellartemp). In a more scholarly article<a name=\"infrared\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#infrared), the authors proposed a revised Infrared Flux method to determine stellar effective temperature with reduced numerical working and further insight into the method. They revisited the assumption that the effective temperature $T_e$ is related to integrated stellar flux and monochromatic stellar flux; combining these two relations, they derived a equation that gives the ratio of integrated stellar flux to monochromatic flux, which also includes the $T_e$ term and can be solved for. However, as they later concluded in the \"Sensitivity and Accuracy of Method\" section, the accuracy of the Infrared Flux method is limited by the accuracy with which the ratio can be measured, which in turn depends on the accuracy of the absolute flux measurements across spectral regions. In a more recent research paper<a name=\"gaia\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#gaia), in fact, 40 years after the first reference article was published, we are presented with yet another advancement in precise derivation of stellar effective temperature. Nonetheless, the Gaia EDR3 photometry method is still bounded by other measurements and factors like the $K_s$ band, Gaia color, stellar blending, etc. All these prove that \"temperature\" is not a measurement as straightforward as it may seem when it comes to astronomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we believe if we are able to use machine learning techniques to \"brute-forcedly\" and reliably classify a star, it would make this classification process more interpretable to astronomy newbies like us and the save the experts a great deal of work all at once when deriving the stellar temperature is not absolutely necessary."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we proposed to predict the Morgan-Keenan spectral class of a given/newly-observed star using the minimum number of features from a pool of features such as luminosity, absolute visual magnitude, right ascension/declination, etc. while maintaining above 90% accuracy. This problem can be approached by practical machine learning methods such as decision tree, KNN, etc. The result can be evaluated by the accuracy comparing the predicted category and the real category in our training & testing dataset. With correct method and model, this solution should be replicable."

    "### What an observation consists of: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each observation contains the location (where the star is located and how far it is) and some critical characteristics of each star, including its brightness, energy, color, etc. There are a total of 36 variables in each observation (some of the variables might not be available) We will use some of the critical variables below to classify star types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some critical variables in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spect: The star's spectral type. There are seven main types of stars: OBAFGKM, where O corresponds to the hottest, most powerful stars (and usually the largest) and M corresponds to the coolest, least powerful stars (and usually the smallest). The spectral type of the star will be the labels in our supervised machine learning model.\n",
    "- Distance: The star's distance in parsecs. Distance is one of the traits that we need to consider in our model because the farther away the star is from, the dimmer the star will be. We will need to use distance to more accurately measure the luminosity and the brightness of the stars.\n",
    "- Mag: The star's apparent visual magnitude. We will use the star’s apparent magnitude to determine how bright the star actually is if we observe it from the earth.\n",
    "- AbsMag: The star's absolute visual magnitude, which will be the start’s visual magnitude if we observe 10 parsecs away from the star.  This identity is crucial because it tells us how bright the star “actually” is. If a star’s absolute visual magnitude is high, it is very likely that the star has a large size and high energy.\n",
    "- Ci: The start’s B-V color index. This index will indicate the star’s color, which will be an efficient way to indicate the star’s temperature and energy. It is defined as the difference between the blue magnitude and the star’s visual magnitude. The larger the B-V color index, the higher temperature the star will be at (and also, the star will appear bluer)\n",
    "- Lum: The star's luminosity. This variable is defined by the total electromagnetic power emitted by the star in a given time, and it is shown as a multiple of the solar luminosity (where the sun’s luminosity will be defined as 1). The higher the luminosity the star is, the more energy it will release in a given time period. In other words, the higher the luminosity, the more powerful the star is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Any special handling, transformations, cleaning, etc will be needed: \n",
    "\n",
    "- This dataset contains some variables that we will not be used in classification so we will clean the data to make sure we only have the data we need. Also, the star’s spectral type contains a subtype for each class. For example, in class F, we might have F5 or F0V, etc. We will also clean the data so that we only use the general type to classify star type in order to reduce model complexity."
